# Dream11 Team Selection Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Dream11 Team Selection project! This project is designed to help you create the best possible team for the IPL season without the stress of manual selection. Using advanced algorithms, the project selects the top players across all four fields—Wicket Keeping, Batting, All Rounders, and Bowlers—while maintaining optimal credit score utilization. The maximum credit score is 100, and players must be chosen within the limitations of the number of players allowed in each specialized field. This ensures that no field is neglected and you get the best possible team to enhance your chances of winning.
